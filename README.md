# Modern-day Numerology: Numbers to Remember

According to your numerology profile contains many numbers but the seven most significant include thee birthday number, current name number, personality number, maturity number, soul number destiny number, and life path number

These numbers can be calculated based on the Pythagorean or Chaldean Numerology Systems. These frameworks are used to convert letters into numbers, and the main contrast between these two is that the Chaldean framework does not have any letters connected with the number 9. Another distinction is is that the Chaldean framework utilized sounds and tones to relate letters and numbers. Pythagorean framework doles out the numbers in arrangement so A=1, B2, C=3, etc. You can utilize either framework, but the Chaldean framework is the more established of the two, also the oldest one if the two.
